# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a lead developer and architect with 12+ years of experience in the industry. I specialize in blockchain and microservices, with a focus on Go, Rust, Solidity, Ethereum, and other related technologies. I currently lead the Go team at [Gateway.fm](https://gateway.fm) and am a co-founder at [UddÃ¹g Team](https://uddug.com), where we build open source web3 projects and provide full-cycle development for startups.
